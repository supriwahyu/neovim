# Neovim configuration .vimrc

## Step 1: Install neovim.

```
sudo apt install neovim
```

## Step 2: Configure config file.

Config file is located in {home}$/.config/nvim/init.vimrc
and the configuration for package manager

But if you want to use this configuration just paste the code.
first, copy config folder in home folder.
secondly, copy the .vimrc exactly inside the home folder.

## Step 3: Install package manager.

If all is good to go, the rest is pretty simple.
you just need open the veovim in terminal.
then type :PlugInstall in vim command.
all it because the config is already set, so it easy to go.

## Feature
The feature of plugin install in this configuration is pretty cool.
have sidebar of tree-file panel on the left, highlighting error code like vscode, have autocomplete, and more.

thanks.
